#	This is a very simple sample program that demonstrates how to use Color 
#	QuickDraw.  It is about two pages of code, and does nothing more than open
#	a color window and draw randomly colored ovals in the window.
#	
#	The purpose is to show how to get some initial results with Color QuickDraw.
#	It is a complete program and is very short to be as clear as possible.
#	
#	It does not have an Event Loop.  It is not fully functional in the sense that
#	it does not do all the things you would expect a well behaved Macintosh 
#	program to do, like size the window naturally, have an event loop, use menus, 
#	etc.
#
#	See Sample and TESample for the general structure and MultiFinder techniques that
#	we recommend that you use when building a new application.

	Version 1.0:	6/2/88
					7/20/88	 DJB	Converted to C
	
	purpose		To demonstrate a simple color App using Color QuickDraw.
						It draws colored balls in a color window, then uses colored
						text inverted in the ball.  The ball location and color is Random.
						
						This program was written by Bo3b Johnson, 1/88.
						
						The inverted Bob text was a Skippy Blair special concept,
						kept for obvious aesthetic reasons.

/* Where does it fit:
	This is a series of sample programs for those doing development
	using Color QuickDraw.  Since the whole color problem depends
	upon the exact effect desired, there are a number of answers
	to how to use colors, from the simple to the radically complex.
	These programs try to cover the gamut, so you should use 
	which ever seems appropriate.  In most cases, use the simplest
	one that will give the desired results.  The compatibility
	rating is from 0..9 where low is better.  The more known risks 
	there are the higher the rating.
	
	
	The programs (in order of compatibility):
	
		SillyBalls:	(***)
			This is the simplest use of Color QuickDraw, and does
			not use the Palette Manager.  It draws randomly colored
			balls in a color window.  This is intended to give you
			the absolute minimum required to get color on the screen.
			Written in straight Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 0, no known risks.
		
		FracAppPalette:
			This is a version of FracApp that uses only the Palette
			Manager.  It does not support color table animation
			since that part of the Palette Manager is not sufficient.
			The program demonstrates a full color palette that is
			used to display the Mandelbrot set.  It uses an offscreen
			gDevice w/ Port to handle the data, using CopyBits to
			draw to the window.  The Palette is automatically 
			associated with each window.  The PICT files are read
			and written using the bottlenecks, to save on memory
			useage.
			Written in MacApp Object Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 0, no known risks.
		
		TubeTest:
			This is a small demo program that demonstrates using the
			Palette Manager for color table animation.  It uses a 
			color palette with animating entries, and draws using the
			Palette Manager.  There are two circles of animating colors
			which gives a flowing tube effect.  This is a valid case
			for using the animating colors aspect of the Palette Manager,
			since the image is being drawn directly.
			Written in straight Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 0, no known risks.
		
		FracApp:
			This is the ‘commercial quality’ version of FracApp.  This
			version supports color table animation, using an offscreen
			gDevice w/ Port, and handles multiple documents.  The
			CopyBits updates to the screen are as fast as possible.  The
			program does not use the Palette Manager, except to
			provide for the system palette, or color modes with less than
			255 colors.  For color table animation using an offscreen
			gDevice w/ Port, it uses the Color Manager and handles the
			colors itself.  Strict compatibility was relaxed to allow for
			a higher performance program.  This is the most ‘real’ of the
			sample programs.
			Written in MacApp Object Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 2.  (nothing will break, but it may not
				always look correct.)
		
		FracApp300:
			This doesn't support colors, but demonstrates how to create and
			use a 300 dpi bitmap w/ Port.  The bitmap is printed at full
			resolution on LaserWriters, and clipped on other printers (but
			they still print).  It demonstrates how to use a high resolution
			image as a PICT file, and how to print them out.
			Written in MacApp Object Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 1.  (The use of PrGeneral is slightly 
				out of the ordinary, although supported.)
