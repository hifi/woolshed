#
#	The TubeTest program is a simple demonstration of how to use the Palette 
#	Manager in a color program.  It has a special color palette that is associated
#	with the main window.  The colors are animated using the Palette Manager 
#	to give a flowing tube effect.  The program is very simple, and the Palette
#	Manager and drawing parts are put in separate subroutines to make it easier
#	to figure out what is happening.
#	
#	The program is still a complete Macintosh application with a Main Event Loop,
#	so there is the extra code to run the MEL.  
#	
#	There is a resource file that is necessary as well, to define the Menus, Window,
#	Dialog, and Palette resources used in the program.  
#
#	See Sample and TESample for the general structure and MultiFinder techniques that
#	we recommend that you use when building a new application.

	TubeTest -- A small sample application written by Bo3b Johnson.
	The idea is to draw two circles in varying colors in the window, then
	animate the colors when the menu is chosen.	This is a complete program
	with event loop and everything.	It is intended to be a simple example of
	how to use the Palette Manager to do some minor color animation, and
	how to use the PM to set up the colors desired in a window.
	
	Also see the resource file that goes with this to see how the Palette 
	itself is layed out.
	
	Could be built with something like this:
		rez TubeTest.r -o TubeTest
		C -r TubeTest.C

/* Where does it fit:
	This is a series of sample programs for those doing development
	using Color QuickDraw.  Since the whole color problem depends
	upon the exact effect desired, there are a number of answers
	to how to use colors, from the simple to the radically complex.
	These programs try to cover the gamut, so you should use 
	which ever seems appropriate.  In most cases, use the simplest
	one that will give the desired results.  The compatibility
	rating is from 0..9 where low is better.  The more known risks 
	there are the higher the rating.
	
	
	The programs (in order of compatibility):
	
		SillyBalls:
			This is the simplest use of Color QuickDraw, and does
			not use the Palette Manager.  It draws randomly colored
			balls in a color window.  This is intended to give you
			the absolute minimum required to get color on the screen.
			Written in straight Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 0, no known risks.
		
		FracAppPalette:
			This is a version of FracApp that uses only the Palette
			Manager.  It does not support color table animation
			since that part of the Palette Manager is not sufficient.
			The program demonstrates a full color palette that is
			used to display the Mandelbrot set.  It uses an offscreen
			gDevice w/ Port to handle the data, using CopyBits to
			draw to the window.  The Palette is automatically 
			associated with each window.  The PICT files are read
			and written using the bottlenecks, to save on memory
			useage.
			Written in MacApp Object Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 0, no known risks.
		
		TubeTest:	(***)
			This is a small demo program that demonstrates using the
			Palette Manager for color table animation.  It uses a 
			color palette with animating entries, and draws using the
			Palette Manager.  There are two circles of animating colors
			which gives a flowing tube effect.  This is a valid case
			for using the animating colors aspect of the Palette Manager,
			since the image is being drawn directly.
			Written in straight Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 0, no known risks.
		
		FracApp:
			This is the ‘commercial quality’ version of FracApp.  This
			version supports color table animation, using an offscreen
			gDevice w/ Port, and handles multiple documents.  The
			CopyBits updates to the screen are as fast as possible.  The
			program does not use the Palette Manager, except to
			provide for the system palette, or color modes with less than
			255 colors.  For color table animation using an offscreen
			gDevice w/ Port, it uses the Color Manager and handles the
			colors itself.  Strict compatibility was relaxed to allow for
			a higher performance program.  This is the most ‘real’ of the
			sample programs.
			Written in MacApp Object Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 2.  (nothing will break, but it may not
				always look correct.)
		
		FracApp300:
			This doesn't support colors, but demonstrates how to create and
			use a 300 dpi bitmap w/ Port.  The bitmap is printed at full
			resolution on LaserWriters, and clipped on other printers (but
			they still print).  It demonstrates how to use a high resolution
			image as a PICT file, and how to print them out.
			Written in MacApp Object Pascal code.
			Compatibility rating = 1.  (The use of PrGeneral is slightly 
				out of the ordinary, although supported.)
